            <h3>About the Course</h3>
            
            <p>Since the data grows exponentially and becomes complex, we need computational methods to collect, store, and analyze them in order to be successful in science, engineering, business, and other professions. BMGT404, “Essential Data Skills for Business Analytics”, is an introductory programming class that meets this need. You will learn how to write computer programs in Python language to solve real-world problems and how to use tableau to explain your results as a report in a more readable way. This will be useful in your research and your jobs in the future. </p>
            
            <p>This class is designed for students that want to learn to computer programming for data science. This course guides students through the basic Python programming language, from initial concepts to final data analysis using python and external packages.</p>
            
            <p>The (tentative) list of topics that we plan to cover:
            <ul>
            <li>Basic programming concepts</li>
            <li>Install and run Python programs</li>
            <li>Variables and expressions</li>
            <li>Control structures: sequence, branch, iteration</li>
            <li>List, tuple, dictionary in Python</li>
            <li>Functions, parameters, and recursion in Python</li>
            <li>String operations</li>
            <li>File operations and modules</li>
            <li>Regular expression</li>
            <li>Visualization</li>
            <li>Database operations</li>
            <li>Data manipulation: Pandas</li>
            <li>Scientific computing: NumPy</li>
            <li>Natural language processing package: NLTK</li>
            <li>Machine learning in Python: Mlpy and Scikit-learn</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Prerequisites</h5>
            <p>The course does not require any prior programming background or experiences. Students that enroll in the class are expected to have some basic familiarity with programming in other languages, at the introductory level (i.e., R, matlab, SAS, etc.), however no prior knowledge of Python is required. Since this course contains hands-on labs, (I prefer) you are expected to bring your laptop to every class (and remember to charge it, so that it lasts for the duration of the class).</p>
            
            <h5>Course Objectives</h5>
            <p>At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
            <ul>
            <li>Understand the architecture, basic elements, and the planning of data science</li>
            <li>Understand and use standard sequential, conditional, and iterative control structure of automated data analysis through computers</li>
            <li>Understand and use off-the-shelf packages to solve business related applications, such as resource allocation, finance, accounting, information system management, and many others</li>
            <li>Understand how to manipulate data (store, query, and summarize) using database for analyzing structured data</li>
            <li>Understand and use computer programming for basic interactive web applications<li>
            <li>Understand and use computer programming to collect, analyze, and visualize business data</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Tools we will use</h5>
            <p>The tools that we will learn to use in the class include:
            <ul>

            <li>Scientific python package Numpy (<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">http://www.numpy.org/</a>)</li>
            <li>Using Python and SQL to create and query relational databases, using MySQL</li>
            <li>Python Pandas (<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">http://pandas.pydata.org/</a>) for handling and visualizing structured data and time series</li>
            <li>Matplotlib (<a href="http://matplotlib.org/">http://matplotlib.org/</a>) for visualization</li>
            <li>•	Machine learning packages: Mlpy (<a href="http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/docs/3.5/">http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/docs/3.5/</a>) and scikit-learn (<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html">http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html</a>) </li>

            <h3>About me</h3>
            
            <p>If you're interested in my research, here is
            <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~kpzhang/">my homepage</a>. The
            best way to get in touch with me is via email, at kzhang@rhsmith.umd.edu. I
            am available by appointment to discuss material from class, homework assignments, the labs, etc.  Email is the best
            way to reach me to set up an appointment, and it's also a good way to
            get a quick answer to a simple question.</p>

                    <table class="table">
                        <tbody>

            <h3>Assignments</h3>
            <p>You are free to submit late, but there is a 10% grade penalty for every additional day after the deadline. Given the generous late submission policy, penalties are strictly enforced, and no extensions are granted. Please plan accordingly, and do not leave submission for the last minute.</p>
            
            <p>Plagiarism Policy: Inevitably in a programming course, it seems that a few people will turn in work that is not their own. You should understand that it is usually easy to detect copying of programs -- even when a program is modified to try to disguise its source. Copying a program, or letting someone else copy your program, is a form of academic dishonesty and the penalties can be found here (<a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/about-us/academic-integrity">http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/about-us/academic-integrity</a>).</p>

            <h3>Class Attendance</h3>
            
            <p>University policies excuse the absences of students for illness, religious observances, participation in University activities at the request of university authorities and compelling circumstances beyond the student's control. Regular attendance and participation in this class is the best way to grasp the concepts and principles being discussed. However, in the event that a class must be missed due to illness, the policy in this class is as follows:<br>
            1.	For every medically necessary absence from class (lecture, recitation, or lab), a reasonable effort should be made to notify the instructor in advance of the class. When returning to class, students must bring a note identifying the date of and reason for the absence, and acknowledging that the information in the note is accurate.<br>
            2.	If a student is absent more than 3 times, the instructor may require documentation signed by a health care professional.<br>
            3.	If a student is absent on days when tests are scheduled, he or she is required to notify the instructor in advance, and upon returning to class, bring documentation of the illness, signed by a health care professional.<br>
            4.  No students can receive A if absence 5 or more classes. 
            </p>
            
            <b>Accommodations for Disabilities.</b> The University is legally
            obligated to provide appropriate accommodations for students with
            documented disabilities.  Accommodations will be made only in
            accordance with University policy.  Students who are entitled to
            accommodations due to disabilities must first set up an appointment
            with the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability
                Support Services (DSS)</a>. To permit adequate planning, this process
            must be completed and I must be notified by DSS at least two weeks
            before the session in which the accommodation is required.</p>
            
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>The use of cellular phones, tablets, or computers for non-course purposes will not be allowed without the prior consent of the presiding faculty member. Students using phones during class or participating in other disruptive activities will be asked to leave out of respect for fellow students and faculty. Eating or drinking during skills activities, texting/web surfings, working on other courses' material, or other activities that distract from course activities are not allowed. Audio or video recording of any course activity needs express permission of the instructors.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
            
            <p>Here is a tentative schedule of lectures, readings, and labs for this course. We will try to keep approximately to this schedule.<br>
            (Note that we may change the schedule during the semester.)</p>
