                        <!--p>Since the data grows exponentially and becomes complex, we need computational methods to collect, store, and analyze them in order to be successful in science, engineering, business, and other professions. BMGT404, “Essential Data Skills for Business Analytics”, is an introductory programming class that meets this need. You will learn how to write computer programs in Python language to solve real-world problems and how to use tableau to explain your results as a report in a more readable way. This will be useful in your research and your jobs in the future.
                        
                        This class is designed for students that want to learn to computer programming for data science. This course guides students through the basic Python programming language, from initial concepts to final data analysis using python and external packages.</p-->

                        <!---- As the web technology and mobile use rapidly evolves, people are becoming more and more enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and communicating with each other through different social platforms, communities, and media. In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different domains, with particular focus on business, healthcare, and social networks, causing the volume of user-generated data to expand exponentially. The distillation of knowledge from such a large amount of unstructured, dynamically changed, and various information is an extremely difficult task without the help of distributed techniques. In this graduate-level course, we introduce most state-of-the-art techniques for big data analytical techniques (clustering, recommender systems, topic modeling, sentiment identification, and social network analysis) and distributed data management tools (Apache Hbase, Hive, and Pig). It has several labs and students need to do a term project which can gain practical hands-on experience.-->
